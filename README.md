# stacksearch
Stack Search is an Android Studio plugin that helps the user to search the highlighted text on Stack Overflow.
The plugin was developed in IntelliJ IDEA (Version 2019.2.4).
Only basic IntelliJ packages were used in the development so the plugin can function with almost every IDE based on IntelliJ (Including Android Studio).
Usage is very simple, the user has to highlight the code and press the plugin icon in the toolbar.

This was a part of my bachelor thesis and the whole development process has helped me expand my programming knowledge.
